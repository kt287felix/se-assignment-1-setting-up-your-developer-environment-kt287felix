# Developer Environment Setup for Flutter App

## Introduction
This document provides a step-by-step guide for setting up a developer environment on [Operating System] for developing a Flutter application. It covers the installation and configuration of essential tools, frameworks, and dependencies required for Flutter development.

## Prerequisites
- A computer running [Operating System] (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- An internet connection for downloading required software

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Flutter SDK
- Visit the official Flutter website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
- Download the latest stable version of Flutter SDK for your operating system
- Follow the installation instructions provided on the website

### 2. Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- Install Android Studio or Visual Studio Code (recommended IDEs for Flutter development)
  - For Android Studio:
    - Visit the official website: https://developer.android.com/studio
    - Download the latest version for your operating system
    - Install Android Studio by following the prompts in the installer
    - Install the Flutter and Dart plugins within Android Studio
  - For Visual Studio Code:
    - Visit the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
    - Download the latest version for your operating system
    - Install Visual Studio Code by following the prompts in the installer
    - Install the Flutter and Dart extensions within Visual Studio Code

### 3. Set up Android Studio (for Android app development)
- Install the latest version of Android Studio
- Install the Android SDK
- Configure Android device emulators or connect a physical Android device

### 4. Set up Xcode (for iOS app development, macOS only)
- Install the latest version of Xcode from the App Store
- Configure iOS simulators or connect a physical iOS device

### 5. Install Flutter Dependencies
- Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install the required dependencies:
  ```
  flutter doctor
  ```
- Follow the instructions provided by the `flutter doctor` command to resolve any issues or missing dependencies

### 6. Create a New Flutter Project
- Open your IDE (Android Studio or Visual Studio Code)
- Create a new Flutter project by following the prompts in the IDE

### 7. Run Your Flutter App
- In your IDE, locate the main.dart file (the entry point of your Flutter app)
- Run the app by clicking the appropriate run button or using the command:
  ```
  flutter run
  ```
- Select the target device (emulator, simulator, or physical device) to run the app

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues during the setup process, refer to the official Flutter documentation for troubleshooting steps: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/troubleshooting
